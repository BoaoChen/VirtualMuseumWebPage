            <h2>3D Model: Bronze Sun Wheel</h2>
    
            <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
            <p>The shape of the vessel is round, with a raised interior in the middle, and five awns arranged radially around it, with the awn strips connected 
                to the outer wheel. The central circular hole inside and the five equidistant circular holes on the wheel are used for installation and fixation. 
                This type of vessel has never been seen in previous unearthed cultural relics. Its overall image features are quite similar to the rock paintings 
                of the Bai nationality hanging coffin tombs in Gong County, Sichuan, and the sun symbol on the bronze drums unearthed in southern my country. 
                Therefore, the excavators named it a "sun-shaped vessel". However, some researchers believe that this shape does not symbolize the sun, but a 
                wheel: the center is the hub, the radial strips are the spokes, and the outer ring is the rim. Most opinions believe that this type of vessel 
                should be a "sun-shaped vessel", which is a sacred vessel often placed in the temples of the ancient Shu Kingdom.
